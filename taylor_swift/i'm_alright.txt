Those green eyes
And that contagious smile
And those lips, and the way they verbalize
New York city
What a beauty to our eyes
Then you held my hand the first time
You looked at me and smiled

Everything was perfect
Everything was great
I was on a fairytale
It's a dream when I'm awake
But days passed and we weren't there
And it felt like we didn't care anymore. Anymore

But why'd we say goodbye?
We said we didn't have enough time, for both of us
We said we try, to work things out
But all a' sudden we're all tired
And said goodbye

Its sad not to hear you calling me up at 3 am
No ones ever gonna sing to me Stevie Wonder songs again
I'll miss your kiss and your curly hair
But now that we said goodbye
I'll pretend that I'm alright
I'm alright, yeah I'm alright
You said you didn't wanna see me cry
but I'll pretend that I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright

I'll miss you holding hotel keys
And watch you sing to girls with happy tears
When your on stage, your pointing at me, you sing to me, as I chant your name
And as the spotlights disappear
It's a different person that I'm with
So much simpler, so much better, and just so beautiful...
The way we laugh with four more guys
You walk around naked and cover my eyes
Your just so funny
I can't believe that were letting this go

But why'd we say goodbye?
We said we didn't have enough time for both of us
We said we try, to work things out
But all a' sudden we're all tired
And said goodbye

Its sad not to hear you calling me up at 3 am
No ones ever gonna sing to me Stevie Wonder songs again
I'll miss your kiss and your curly hair
But now that we said goodbye
I'll pretend that I'm alright
yeah I'm alright, I'm alright
You said you didn't wanna see me cry
I'll pretend that I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright

But maybe its time to let it go
Maybe its better off alone
Maybe today's the wrong time
Someday we'll learn to be strong
Maybe your right about this,
We're busy people with busy lives.
We can't keep up on this,
So goodbye

Call me up at three am
Sing me Stevie wonder songs again
Your kiss and your curly hair,
I never wanna say goodbye
Cause we're alright.
